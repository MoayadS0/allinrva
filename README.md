## The Files

### *.html
There are 5 main pages for our site right now. index.html is the landing page.
Everything else that ends in *.html is also a main site page. Html works with
a system of tags and slashes /< /> //
~~~~~
<tag-name>  You put your tag name inside the carats to open a new tag.
    And any kind of content, even just english words, can go inside.
        <other-tag-name> You can nest tags inside each other like this </other-tag-name>
    But you always close the tagged section back up, with a slash tag.
</tag-name>

### *.css
This is a design system for the html. Colors, fonts, sizes, positions, animations,
and everything else can be coded in here.
